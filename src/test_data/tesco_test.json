That's why we've been developing smaller flocks - encouraging our ladies to roam as freely as possible. Our unique light soil environment is perfect for chickens to scratch around and dust bathe, with renewable energy from the wind and sun, generated on our farm to look after them. All our eggs are packed in our Lion Coded packing station on our farm, meaning our food miles are kept ridiculously low. We hope you enjoy our eggs. Toby Rush Rymer Farm Our hens are free to roam outside during the day and are fed on a diet enriched with corn and wheat. They produce beautiful eggs which are packed on the farm in the heart of East Anglia. Sometimes we buy eggs in from other quality producers but rest assured that every egg we sell will always be Free Range.
