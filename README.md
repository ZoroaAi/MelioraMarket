# Meliora Market - Price Comparison Website

## Introduction

Welcome to Meliora Market - the ultimate price comparison website for UK groceries! üõçÔ∏èüçéüçûüçÖ

## Overview

Meliora Market is a UK supermarket price comparison website designed to help users easily compare prices of various products across multiple supermarkets in the UK. The web application is built using Flask, Python, HTML/CSS, and Selenium. I have also web scraped the market data to ensure that the prices are up-to-date and accurate.

## Features

In addition to the features already mentioned, my website offers the following functionality:

- **Browse Products:** Users can browse through products that were web scraped from Tesco and Morrisons

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Basket:** Users can create a basket list of their favourite products, allowing them to quickly and easily compare prices across multiple supermarkets.

## Getting Started

To get started with my website, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

```python
python main.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can then access the website by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
