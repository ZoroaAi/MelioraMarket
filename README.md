# Meliora Market - Price Comparison Website

üëã Welcome to Meliora Market, my final year individual project for the University of Portsmouth!

## Overview

Meliora Market is a UK supermarket price comparison website designed to help users easily compare prices of various products across multiple supermarkets in the UK. The web application is built using Flask, Python, HTML/CSS, and Selenium. I have also web scraped the market data to ensure that the prices are up-to-date and accurate.

## Features

In addition to the features already mentioned, my website offers the following functionality:

- üó£Ô∏è **User Reviews:** Users can leave reviews for products they have purchased, providing valuable feedback to other users and helping them make informed purchasing decisions.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Favourites List:** Users can create a list of their favourite products, allowing them to quickly and easily compare prices across multiple supermarkets.

- üí∞ **Price Alerts:** Users can set up price alerts for specific products, so they are notified when the price drops below a certain threshold.

- üîç **Recommendations:** Using machine learning algorithms, my website can provide personalised recommendations for products that users might be interested in purchasing based on their browsing and purchasing history.

- ‚ôø **Accessibility:** My website has been designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it is easy to use for people with disabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with my website, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

```python
python main.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can then access the website by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
